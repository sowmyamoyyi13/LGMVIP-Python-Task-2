# LGMVIP-Python-Task-2
# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake Game implemented in Python using the Turtle module. The game allows the player to control a snake, moving it around the screen to eat food and grow longer. The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.

## Features

- Snake movement using arrow keys or WASD keys.
- Random generation of food for the snake to eat.
- Score tracking and display.
- Game over screen when the snake collides with the walls or itself.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
3. Run the `snake_game.py` file.
4. Use the arrow keys or WASD keys to control the snake.
5. Eat the food to score points and grow longer.
6. Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

- Python 3
- Turtle module (included in Python standard library)
